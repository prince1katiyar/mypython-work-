    "User-defined data types: If you are working with user-defined data types,\n",

    "Domain-specific languages: If you are designing a domain-specific language (DSL),\n",
    "you can use operator overloading to define the semantics of the language. \n",
    "For example, if you are designing a language for linear algebra, \n",
    "you can overload the + operator to represent vector addition and the * operator to represent matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressiveness: If you want to make your code more expressive and easier to read,\n",
    "you can use operator overloading to make it more similar to mathematical expressions.\n",
    "This can make it easier to understand the intent of the code and can reduce the cognitive load on the reader.\n",
