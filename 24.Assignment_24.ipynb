    "#### Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module. It is used in case when we have to import multiple functions from same module. "

    "- **`__name__`** : It returns the name of the module\n",
    "- **`__doc__`** : It denotes the documentation string line written in a module code.\n",
    "- **`__file__`** : It holds the name and path of the module file from which it is loaded\n",
    "- **`__dict__`** : It return a dictionary object of module attributes, functions and other definitions and their respective values"

    "#### Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "**Ans:** Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in `MOD1.py` file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say\n",
    "`MOD2.PY` file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an `import error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because when we import F2() function from module `MOD2.py`, then this will execute `MOD2.py` file. And in `MOD2.py` file there is an another statement of importing `MOD1.py` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will result in endless loop. To avoid this error just do one thingWe can use if `__name__ == '__main__'`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function, you can't directly refer to the function in the program. The addition of this sentence avoids the endless loop of the program ."

    "#### Q5. In what situation is it useful to refer to the `__name__` attribute or the string `__main__` ?\n",
    "**Ans:** During the time of execution of the code if we want to refer the module in which we are working on then we uses name attribute. In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if that moudle is being imported from some other module then name will have the name of that moudle from where the current module has been imported. The current module in which we are working is refer to the string `__main __`."

    "#### Q6. What are some of the benefits of attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application, which interprets an RPN script line by line?\n",
    "**Ans:** Attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application, which interprets an RPN script line by line, can offer several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Facilitates error detection and debugging: With a program counter, it becomes easier to detect errors and debug RPN scripts. When an error is detected, the program counter can be used to identify the specific line of code that caused the error. This saves time and effort in locating the error and makes the debugging process more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Allows for the implementation of control flow constructs: The use of a program counter allows the RPN interpreter to implement control flow constructs such as loops and conditional statements. These constructs enable the interpreter to perform complex operations and calculations, which would not be possible with a simple linear execution model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improves performance: By using a program counter, the RPN interpreter can skip over unused or unnecessary lines of code, improving its performance. This is because the interpreter does not need to execute every line of code in the script, which reduces the amount of time and resources required for the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Supports interactive programming: A program counter enables interactive programming with RPN scripts, where the user can input RPN commands or lines of code in real-time. The program counter can be used to keep track of the current line of code being executed and provide real-time feedback to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, attaching a program counter to an RPN interpreter application can improve its functionality, performance, and usability."

    "#### Q7. What are the minimum expressions or statements (or both) that you'd need to render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but completeâ€” that is, capable of carrying out any computerised task theoretically possible?\n",
    "**Ans:** To render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but complete, you would need the following minimum expressions or statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arithmetic operators: The programming language should support arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to perform basic mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stack manipulation operators: The programming language should have operators for manipulating the stack, such as push (PUSH) and pop (POP), which allow you to add and remove values from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Control flow constructs: The programming language should support control flow constructs, such as conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE) and loops (WHILE or FOR), to enable the execution of complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Input and output functions: The programming language should support input and output functions to enable the program to interact with the user and other external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Variables: The programming language should support variables to store and manipulate values, which can be useful for implementing more complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Functions: The programming language should support the definition and use of functions, which enable the code to be modular and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these basic expressions and statements, a programming language like RPN can theoretically carry out any computerised task. However, the efficiency and ease of use of the language may be limited without additional features such as data structures, object-oriented programming, and error handling mechanisms."
